# ALADINO: Aligning Architectures for Digital Twin of the Organization 
The ALADINO project aims at establishing a set of sound engineering methodologies, methods and tools for modeling, evaluating, and evolving a Digital Twin of the Organization.


## About the project
A digital twin is a computerised model that reproduces an object – a product, a process or an entire company – in its environment and that may be used for troubleshooting of existing objects as well as development of new objects.

A Digital Twin of the Organization (DTO) is an accurate virtual representation of the organization, including digital replicas of physical devices, processes, services, people and places. Indeed, a DTO allows for representing all the organization’s elements as virtual models, which can be continuously simulated and analyzed for assessing and optimizing the organization. To this extent, DTOs exploit the power of Cyber-Physical Systems and Data Driven Technologies to make the organization context-aware, self-aware, and adaptive; that is, a Smarter System.
